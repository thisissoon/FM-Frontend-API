# waterline-fmapi

Provides easy access to the FM API from Sails.js & Waterline.

This module is a Waterline/Sails adapter, an early implementation of a rapidly-developing, tool-agnostic data standard.  Its goal is to provide a set of declarative interfaces, conventions, and best-practices for integrating with all sorts of data sources.  Not just databases-- external APIs, proprietary web services, or even hardware.

Strict adherence to an adapter specification enables the (re)use of built-in generic test suites, standardized documentation, reasonable expectations around the API for your users, and overall, a more pleasant development experience for everyone.


### Installation

To install this adapter, run:

```sh
$ npm install waterline-fmapi
```




### Usage

This adapter exposes the following methods:

###### `find()`

###### `create()`

###### `update()`

###### `destroy()`



### Interfaces

This adapter implements the [semantic](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/adapter-specification.md#semantic-interface) interface and support for the [subscribable](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/contributing/adapter-specification.md#subscribable-interface) interface is planed.

For more information, check out this repository's [FAQ](./FAQ.md) and the [adapter interface reference](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/adapter-specification.md) in the Sails docs.


## Development

Check out **Connections** in the Sails docs, or see the `config/connections.js` file in a new Sails project for information on setting up adapters.

### Running the tests

Configure the interfaces you plan to support (and targeted version of Sails/Waterline) in the adapter's `package.json` file:

In your adapter's directory, run:

```sh
$ npm test
```
